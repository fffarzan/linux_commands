# LIBS

Third-party libraries

### Linking

static: connect my programs and all libs statically. Result? A big exe that can run (like games).

dynamic: connect my programs and all libs with a link. Result? When our program is running, OS loads what our program needs from libs.

naming: libLIBNAME.so.VERSION -->

dirs:

- `/lib/`, `/lib64/` : main libraries
- `/usr/lib/`, `/usr/lib64/` : our libraries (shared)

NOTE: install "tree". it's so useful and beautiful!

NOTE: export -> all env vars.

```bash
ldd /usr/bin/ls # shows this program uses what libraries
ldconfig # for configing libs. It's work is finding libs and creating a cache for OS for using libs. It should be static, because it'll be used to fix shared libs problems! The cache file's name is: /etc/ld.so.cache~
ldconfig -v # verbose
ldconfig -p

cat /etc/ld.so.conf # see all configs of libs

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH # for make specific path for libs of our own program
```
