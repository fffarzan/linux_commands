# BIOS & GRUB

GRUB: GRand Unified Bootloader

Bios reads 001 (the first space in the HD with 512B capacity) and runs it as a instructor. This tiny part runs the bigger part of Grub.

Grub loads just a small part of grub in 001. After that, it loads the bigger part.

Before grub, we had LILO.

UEFI loads OS in some stages. Starts with a security stage. In the last stage, it loads a FAT32 with PE executable.

Chain Loader concept: At first, grub passes tasks to the seconad one after it finishes its own tasks and son on.

### Grub legacy (v1)

configs: `/boot/grub/grub.conf` (linked to `/boot/grub/menu.lst`). After loading configs, you can set OSs that you want to load in the menu - you can customize the menu of boot!!! - (with specifying title, root path, kernel path and initrd or initfs path).

after changing configs in above files, we should run:

```bash
grub-install /dev/fd0
grub-install '(fd0)' # or
grub-install /dev/sda # or
```

### Grub2

The possibility of UEFI booting is added in Grub2. In UEFI, it's install in `/boot/efi/EFI/distro-name/`

config file: `grub.cfg`

Note: hd0: first hard disk / hd0,1: first hard disk, part 1
