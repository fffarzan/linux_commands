RPM files are by cpio format. We can convert an rpm file to cpio with `rpm2cpio` command: `rpm2cpio <PKGNAME> > <THE FILE>`

```bash
rpm -i # install
rpm -v # verbose
rpm -e # remove
rpm -U # upgrade or install
rpm -K # checks signitures??
rpm -Uvh *.rpm # install all needed pkgs with showing hashtags.
rpm -V # cheks is the pkg install correctly or not
```
