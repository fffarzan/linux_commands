# PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

Package or app downloading was apperared for the first time on Linux (father of AppStore, Google Play, ...).

debian packages' name: NAME-VERSION-RELEASE_ARCH.deb

Where is the config that say to `apt` where should the system can download repos:

```bash
cd /etc/apt/
less sources.list
```

`sources.lists.d` directory is for our custom repos for updating.

`apt update` or `apt-get update`: Goes to all sources and updates list of all the programs. Puts it in a cache: `/var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin`

All these commands can be run with just `apt`

```bash
sudo apt-get install -s vlc # just simulate installation of vlc.
sudo apt-get install --download-only vlc # just download the packages.
apt-get download tmux # just downloads the exact tmux.deb package without any deps.
sudo apt-get remove tmux # just remove tmux not its deps.
sudo apt-get autoremove # remove all deps that there is no need for them anymore. (after removing tmux for example)
apt-cache search tmux # looks for every app that has tmux inside of it
sudo apt-get install -f tmux # installs all deps that is not installed for specific package
apt-get install -l # lists all the packages
```

`apt-get upgrade`: Checks all the packages with last repo cache and if there is any changes, download the new package and install it.

```bash
dpkg # for a lower layer. For example it just installs the exact deb package (with exact name and version that we told )
dpkg -l # shows all the installed packages on the OS.
```

Purge: for remove all things including packages, deps and configs

```bash
apt-get -P
dppkg -P
dpkg -L bzr # checks all files and dirs a package installed.
# dpkg -S
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata # reconfiguring time zone again
```

For apt-get:

- autoclean: remove unused packages
- clean all: clean everything and start refresh
